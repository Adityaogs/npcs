# Adityaogs — Static Personal Site (GitHub Pages Ready)

This repository contains a static, multi-page personal site for **Adityaogs** with an aesthetic dark theme and neon accents.

## Deploy to GitHub Pages (quick)
1. Create a new GitHub repository (e.g. `adityaogs.github.io` for user pages or any repo for project pages).
2. Push the contents of this folder to the repository's `main` branch.
3. If using `adityaogs.github.io` as the repo name, the site will be live at `https://adityaogs.github.io/` shortly.
   For other repo names, enable GitHub Pages under repository Settings → Pages and choose the `main` branch root.
4. Replace the placeholder links (Discord invite, IP, email) with real links in the HTML files if needed.

## Notes
- Contact forms are static and do not send emails.
- Replace `downloads/*.zip` with real ZIPs for users to download.
- Icons live in `assets/icons/` and are SVGs for easy color/style changes.

Enjoy — if you want, I can also push this repo to your GitHub account (I will need repository access or you can create the repo and I can provide instructions for pushing).
